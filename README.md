For each model, include an example with a dataset (feel free to import a new dataset into the folder too!!)

Files to be written:
- linear regression (single + multivariable + output stats + transforms)
- curve fit
- logistic regression (+ confusion matrix)
- (S)ARIMA(X) (+ box-cox transform)
- Markov chain (+ nonhomogeneous markov chain)
- k-nearest neighbors
- support vector machine (+ all main kernels)
- random forest regression
- xgboost
- ANOVA (though i think spencer has it in his stat_toolbox.py file?)
- ANCOVA (said natasha ;) )
- simple Monte Carlo (essentially an averaged random for loop)

- Excel file reading + formatting
- one-hot encoding + dummy variables
